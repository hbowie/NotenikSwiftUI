Notenik SwiftUI
---------------

This is a note-taking application written in Swift and using SwiftUI. The intended platform is iOS. Still very much a work in progress. The executable Notenik application is available from the Mac App Store. Complete documentation is available at [Notenik.net](https://notenik.net), and is maintaned in a separate [GitHub project](https://github.com/hbowie/notenik-project). 

Some of the Notenik code is now broken out into separate packages. 

* [NotenikLib](https://github.com/hbowie/NotenikLib)
* [NotenikUtils](https://github.com/hbowie/NotenikUtils)
* [NotenikTextile](https://github.com/hbowie/NotenikTextile)
* [NotenikMkdown](https://github.com/hbowie/NotenikMkdown)
